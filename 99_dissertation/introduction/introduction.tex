In 1851, when the Irish Great Famine had not yet ended, census noted that about 1 million people had died for hunger, and a similar number had gone into overseas exile

}. When the time came in 1926, as a result of the Irish independence 5 years earlier, the Central Statistical Office was capable to integrate historical documents since famine and showed the fact that the population was decline of roughly 22\%

} in the 10 years from 1841 to 1851. 

points not only to the corpses of the dead, but also to a ``black hole of identity, naming and meaning'' \citep{luchen41naming}. 

The effects of the Great Famine were far-reaching. It wasn't until 120 years later, in the 1960s, that Ireland's population began to grow consistently due to large-scale emigration, late marriage and a high incidence of permanent celibacy no longer hold \citep{grada1979population}, but it was still nowhere near as large as it had been during the Great Famine

}.
This also makes Ireland one of the few countries in the world to suffer population decline over the past 170 years when the world's population has increased more than six fold
