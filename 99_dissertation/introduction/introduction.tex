The Irish Great Famine (1845 \textendash\ 1851) reshaped the entire history of Ireland. Before the Great Famine, according to the 1841 census, the population of the Ireland had close to 8.5 million

}
. In 1851, when the Irish Great Famine had not yet ended, census noted that about 1 million people had died for hunger, and a similar number had gone into overseas exile
\footnote{

}. In 1926, as a result of the Irish independence 5 years earlier, the Central Statistical Office was capable to integrate historical documents since famine and showed the fact that the population was decline of roughly 22\%

} in the 10 years from 1841 to 1851. Using parish baptism data, some scholars have estimated that in the year 1847 alone \textendash\ which is also known as black'47 in Ireland history \textendash\ there existed counties with a nearly 70\% reduction in baptisms in Munster province in the south of Ireland \citep{cousens1960regional}, especially from southwest Cork and including north and east Clare

}
, while it was not the worst hit by the famine compared to the province of Connacht in the west

}
. Apart from these quantitative explorations, the Great Famine is equally pivotal in Irish cultural history and ethnography. From Joseph O'Connor's fiction ``Star of the sea'' to W. B. Yeats's ``The Countess Cathleen'', together they expressed that the Great Famine not only pointed to the corpses of the dead, but also to a black hole of identity, naming and meaning \citep{luchen41naming}. 

The effects of the Great Famine were far-reaching, and reflected in the long-term population development, land institution structure and attitude to the UK government directly. It was not until 120 years later, in the 1960s, that Ireland's population began to grow consistently due to large-scale emigration, late marriage and a high incidence of permanent celibacy no longer hold \citep{grada1979population}, but it was still nowhere near as large as it had been during the Great Famine

}.
This also makes Ireland one of the few countries in the world to suffer population decline over the past 170 years when the world's population has increased more than 6 fold

}. Regarding the land, on the one hand, in the aftermath of the famine, there was a tendency in Ireland to shift from agriculture to livestock husbandry
\footnote{

}, and on the other hand, when the late blight back in the 1870s, the Land War, which was directed at the landowners and the government, took place at the same time, with a deep consequences for the land structure of Ireland. And finally, there raised hostility between Irish and UK government, which was described as ``a bankruptcy of the British-Irish Union of 1800'' \citep{gray2021great}.

But data on Ireland's food imports and exports show increases in specific commodities, even barley, oats and butter, that violate the characteristics of the Great Famine. In History Ireland magazine, Christine wrote:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \textit{Almost 4,000 vessels carried food from Ireland to the ports of Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool and London during 1847, when 400,000 Irish men, women and children died of starvation and related diseases [\ldots] The most shocking export figures concern butter [\ldots] That works out to be 822,681 gallons of butter exported to England from Ireland.}\footnote{

\end{itemize}
Scholars pondered if potato blight was the root cause of the famine, and they have engaged in many discussions about the origin factor, like Catholic and religious behavior \citep{miller1975irish}, anti-Irish racism \citep{waters1995great}, the poor law and colonial bio-politics \citep{nally2008coming} and, typically, the potato blight \citep{bartoletti2001black}, etc.

Although this day, it is certain that the root causes of the Great Famine, and the following decreasing of population were multiple regardless of the perspective used, historically, the academic attribution of the famine changed \citep{henderson2005irish}:

The narrative travel along the path of Irish history. When nationalism was high, there was a tendency to external attribution; then when the economy and society stabilized, revisionism was born. As Hu Shih, a Chinese philosopher of the 1900s, put it, \textit{Reality, like a block of marble in our hands, is carved into whatever likeness we choose}.

The two main and famous theories surrounded with famine and population change is FAD theory and entitlements theory, which focus on food shortage for the previous and on entitlements failure for the later \citep{nayak2000understanding}, while in Ireland FAD theory became the first stream in analyzing famine during the well-known potato blight. Amatrya's entitlement theory, on the one hand, is more comprehensive compared with FAD theory, on the other hand, is few used in Irish case.

Thus the research questions are raised: (1) Although potato famine existed objectively, can Irish famine and the following population decrease be explained as entitlements failure instead of food shortage? (2) If Amartya's entitlements approach was used in Irish case, which of the people's entitlements suffer the damage and lead to the famine and the following population decrease?

In \textbf{Chapter 2.1}, this paper will review the famine and its damage on Irish population, then rebut FAD theory \textbf{(Chapter 2.2)} and elaborate entitlement approach \textbf{(Chapter 2.3)}. Data and statistics operations will be introduced next, with sources in \textbf{(Chapter 3.1)}, hypothesis in \textbf{(Chapter 3.2)}, statistics description in \textbf{(Chapter 3.3)}, and replication in \textbf{(Chapter 3.4)}. While Using GAM regression method \textbf{(Chapter 4.1)}, this paper review the assumptions (\textbf{(Chapter 4.2)}) and display the results (\textbf{(Chapter 4.3)}) with a complete robustness test (\textbf{Chapter 4.4}). To make everything clear, the research design is put at the end of this chapter (\textbf{(Chapter 4.5)}) with a flowchart to visualization the logic. Finally, discussion is held to interpret the results \textbf{(Chapter 5.1)} and figure out the limitations and further research \textbf{(Chapter 5.2)}, combined with a conclusion \textbf{(Chapter 6)} at the end of the main paper.
