The Irish famine should be examined in the context of the entire 19th century history, rather than discussing the years of the famine alone, which on the one hand would lead to an excessively small sample size and thus ineffective statistics modeling, and on the other hand would lead to a entitlement approach that cannot be analyzed in the context of both positive and negative scenarios of population growth and population decline. Therefore, in collecting data, this paper adopts the strategy of collecting data from 1821 to 1900, where 1821 is the year of the first Irish census with complete documentation, and 1900 marks the end of Ireland's troubled 19th century.

In addition, this paper used population change \textendash\ more specifically, the difference between current year's population and previous year's population \textendash\ as the dependent variable to measure the impact of the entitlement approach on population gap, whether it be pre-famine or post-famine sustained growth or decline, thus  realizing out the causal inference between entitlement approach and population change.

The dataset consists of 26 variables, including 23 dataset variables, with the continuous variable population, various cereal prices, various cereal acreage, various cereal imports and exports, land tax, wages and the categorical variable of if government taxed tithe, also 3 constructed variables, including cereal prices summed up except potatoes, cereal acreage summed up, and the difference in cereal imports and exports. Each year is an observation, totaling 80 observations from 1821 to 1900.

\section{Data Sources}
\vspace{0pt}
The data come from several primary sources, including (1) census data, (2) economic history research papers, and (3) original archival material from the National Library Ireland. Many materials only covered a few years, so this paper filled in the data by combining various materials. For example, regarding the price of oats, the data from 1821 to 1828 were obtained from Daniel's 2021 research, the data from 1829 to 1859 were obtained from Vamplew's 1980 research, and the data from 1850 to 1900 were obtained from Tuner's 1987 research. 

When splicing material from different sources, this paper performs cross validation between the data to ensure accuracy. For example, when both D'Arcy and Bisshop documented wage conditions in 19th century, this paper verified the consistency of the overlapping data from the two papers, and only spliced the data after ensuring. 

Below are all the variables and their sources:

In addition, there are a number of missing values, including the ground rent from 1886 to 1900, the imports of oats, barley, and wheat from 1821 to 1838, and the exports of barley and oats from 1821 to 1828. Considering that these missing values may be related to other variables, the \texttt{mice} package in \texttt{R} is used to fill these missing values with multiple imputation. Since the data in this article come directly from previous research and historical archives, there is no need to deal with outliers.


\section{Research Hypothesis}

The first part of this paper hypothesizes to focus on the trade-based entitlement, and based on the previous discussion, this entitlement consists of grain prices.

\textbf{$H_1$: A damage in trade-based entitlement, more specifically, an increase in the price of oats, wheat, barley, and potatoes lead to an increase in the number of people who die or migrate during the year.}

And when people received harm on their production-based entitlement, such as an unaffordable tax or land rent, that will also leads to a population decrease.

\textbf{$H_2$: A damage in production-based entitlement, more specifically, an increase in the ground rent and to tax the tithe, lead to an increase in the number of people who die or migrate during the year.}

The third is labor and the rewards received for labor, and, as noted earlier, while farmers' incomes were almost never derived from income compared to citizens, it is also necessary to examine the situation of income.

\textbf{$H_3$: A damage in own-labour entitlement, more specifically, an decrease in the wage, lead to an increase in the number of people who die or migrate during the year.}

Because of the ambiguity of data from the Poor Law, we use the balance of imports and exports to estimate people's entitlement in inheritance and transfer \textemdash\
although the balances maybe not necessarily transferred to the people due to situations like policies, corruption or depletion, etc, it is a hypothesis which is deserve to explore.

\textbf{$H_4$: A damage in inheritance and transfer entitlement, more specifically, an increase in the import and export, lead to an increase in the number of people who die or migrate during the year.}

And a final hypothesis test to refute the FAD theory that population decline should not be blamed on acreage or acreage-related yield issues.

\textbf{$H_{5a/5b}$: There is no relationship between planting acreage and the number of people who die or migrate during the year / There is not enough evidence to suggest that larger planting acreage leads to fewer number of people who die or migrate during the year.}

\section{Statistical Description}
The first step is to perform descriptive statistics on two key variables which are population and the amount of population change in the current year which is calculated by subtracting last year's population from the current year's population and also the latter is the dependent variable for the regression analysis carried out in this paper.

The curve in Figure 3.1 represents the change in population over time, with the lower-middle timeline marking the major historical events of the nineteenth century that had an impact on population, while the bar chart at the bottom records the change in population within the year.
