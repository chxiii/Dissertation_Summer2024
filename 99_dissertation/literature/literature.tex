\section{Famine Outline}

The Irish lumper potato with its excellent ability to grow in poor and wet soils, was the predominant potato variety in pre-famine Ireland. It was introduced to U.K. around 1806 \citep{tucker2016potato}, and 


An historic heirloom potato variety introduced in the U.K. around 1806. It is an
inconsistently round-oval, sometimes knobby, white-skinned variety with deep eyes. Flesh
is white and waxy, but taste is poor and culinary use is limited. It was grown widely in
Ireland before the 1845-50 famine because it was prolific and reliable. It was nearly
wiped out by Phytophthora infestans. It was brought to North America by Irish
immigrants. Today, it is rarely grown, but is kept for posterity in several genebanks

On 16 September 1845, Dr Lindley's official announcement was be regarded as the first document recording Irish Great Famine \citep{kelly1995great}.

On 16 September, Dr Lindley made an official announcement
that ‘the potato murrain has unequivocally declared itself in Ireland.’ At the same
time, he posed the question, ‘Where will Ireland be in the event of a universal potato
rot?’



\section{Refuting some hypotheses}

This part I will refute some hypothesis of famine origin. Many people regard single factor as the root of the Great Famine.

1. Blame potato blight as the only origin of famine

People believe potato blight was responsible for the Irish Great Famine.

Blight became a semi-permanent fixture until the end of the century, when effective treatments were found \citep{o1994economic}.

2. Ireland have the bad land quality.

\section{Entitlement Approach}

I will operationalize entitlement approach into these 4 dimensions according to the book:

(1) trade-based entitlement: price, grain amount, 

(2) production-based entitlement: tax policy

(3) own-labour entitlement: wage, land own amount, poor law

(4) inheritance and transfer entitlement: none, hard to get data
