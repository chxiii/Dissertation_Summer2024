\textit{``Hunger roared up in him like a hopeless lust.\\ 
He walked the ship as though following a chart. Up. Down. Across. Back. Stem. Port. Stern. Starboard. The churning of the waves. \\
The ropes clanking on the masts. The blind of salt water. The wind ripping at the sails.''\\

\section{Famine Outline}

The Irish lumper potato, with its excellent ability to grow in poor and wet soils, was the predominant potato variety in pre-famine Ireland.

\section{Refuting some hypotheses}

This part I will refute some hypothesis of famine origin. Many people regard single factor as the root of the Great Famine.

People believe potato blight was responsible for the Irish Great Famine. 

lumper potato

Blight became a semi-permanent fixture until the end of the century, when effective treatments were found \citep{o1994economic}.

\section{Entitlement Approach}

I will operationalize entitlement approach into these 4 dimensions according to the book:

(1) trade-based entitlement: price, grain amount, 

(2) production-based entitlement: tax policy

(3) own-labour entitlement: wage, land own amount, poor law

(4) inheritance and transfer entitlement: none, hard to get data
